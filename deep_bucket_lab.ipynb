    "### 2.2 Defining a Procedure for Model Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Model validation is a critical step in the development of our deep learning model. It helps us verify that the model is functioning as expected, especially when we make changes to hyperparameters. Validation ensures that our model can accurately predict outcomes based on the input data and that it generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the notebook, we define a function to validate and test the LSTM model. This function also checks the water balance of the system, an important aspect of ensuring the model's accuracy in simulating hydrological processes. Here's a brief overview of what the function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Prediction**: It uses the pre-defined LSTM model to make predictions on the validation data.\n",
    "- **Performance Metrics**: The function computes two key metrics, the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), for the `spigot_out` and `mass_overflow` columns of the dataframe. These metrics help us understand how well the model's predictions match the actual data.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: We plot the actual `spigot_out` and `mass_overflow` values against their corresponding LSTM predictions. This visual comparison is crucial for assessing the model's performance.\n",
    "- **Water Balance Check**: The function sums up the input (precipitation), evapotranspiration, mass overflow, spigot outflow, and the last recorded water level, comparing this to the total mass out of or left in the system. This check ensures that the model accurately represents the water balance in the system.\n",
    "- **Mass Residual**: We calculate and print out the percent mass residual as a measure of the system's balance.\n",
